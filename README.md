The analysis covers data loading, cleaning, handling missing values, outlier detection, summary statistics, and visualization (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and pivot tables).

Key insights highlight that:

-> Younger and lower-income customers are more likely to churn.

-> Male customers show higher churn rates compared to females.

-> Higher-income and older customers tend to be more stable.

Recommendations include improving data quality, offering tailored retention strategies for younger and low-income segments, and designing gender-specific engagement initiatives.

This project showcases how EDA can uncover actionable business insights and prepare the ground for predictive modeling.
